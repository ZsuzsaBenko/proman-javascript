# Python with web: Proman
Our assignment was to create a project/task management web application, similar to Trello. Users can create public and private boards, add tasks (or user stories), edit as well as move them using the app's drag-and-drop feature, and finally delete them when they're completed or not needed any more. Private boards are only accessible when logged in, public boards are visible to anyone but editable only for their logged-in owner. The emphasis was on practicing AJAX calls and DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

Technologies: Python / Flask, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.
